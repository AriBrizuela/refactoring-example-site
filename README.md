# Refactoring Example Site
## Description 
    I was tasked by a marketing agency to check out their codebase for accessibility standards. Their website worked without any issues but I did see that there were some code cleaning and fixing I needed to do. MY motivation in this project was to make myself and some other coders life easier. Problems I saw was that they overrused lines when they did not need to, the images did not have an alt link, and one of the headers main did not have a correct anchor reference.
